# ML_Lab_Problem_Statement_8_DBSCAN
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a clustering algorithm that groups data points based on density, identifying clusters of high-density regions while marking outliers as noise. It doesn't require specifying the number of clusters beforehand and is effective for identifying arbitrarily shaped clusters.
